## Images of the network
This is a small experimental installation made during my stay at [sfpc](sfpc.io). The installation sniffs in all the network packages on the local network for image url's, downloads them, and shows them on the screen with a distortion shader. 

The sniffing is done with the ofxLibtins addon i made.
